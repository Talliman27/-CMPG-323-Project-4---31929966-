# Project 4
This project showcases UiPath and Robotic Processing. The user should only run the project on Uipath and they will be logged into the website if not logged in already and will then start reading the data from the excel file into the specific catergories and will then edit the first textbox, save the edited data and then ultimately delete the record. It will do this until it has finished reading and writing all the data into Zone, Categories and Devices and end the project. Orchestrator was used in order to eliminate any passwords to be in the actual code to make it more safe and secure. UiPath was very interesting to use and learn. Finally the Test results will be updated to True if the data was read, written, edited and deleted.
